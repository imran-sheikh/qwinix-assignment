This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, I am removing the default scripts by keeping one or 2 you can run: 

### `npm run dev`

Runs the initial install of the app and then run concurrently the API express server and react scripts set by create-react-app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000] for Application and (http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run start`
This starts the React Application

### `npm run server`
This starts the API server

### `npm run concurrent`
This runs npm run server and npm run start concurrently on 2 different process.


## API Request Postman

## Note: 
This project does not have unit test and uses Semantic UI CSS to style the elements.
